      <h2>Remember</h2>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          You should plan your journey to the assessment - your appointment letter will usually have a map with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your assessor will probably ask you how you got to the assessment. It may affect your claim if the answer you give seems to contradict the answers given on your form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure to ask for a travel reimbursement claim form at the assessment if you do not already have one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you keep bus/ train tickets/ receipts or parking tickets/ receipts for both yourself and anyone who accompanies you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Letters from the DWP</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          You need to take your appointment letter and proof of ID to the assessment. Your letter tells you what is acceptable proof of ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read your appointment letter before you go as it tells you about some other things to take such as new or recent medical letters, glasses, walking aids etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Thinking about the Questions and Preparing Your Answers</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          If your condition has worsened since you completed the form, get a report/ letter from a doctor or other professional to explain how it has changed, and how that impacts on you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down points you want to make about your conditions and their impact on you in case they are not covered/asked about by the assessor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down any questions you may have for the assessor about your appointment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider keeping a diary which you can show the assessor. This will help you track your good and bad days, the impact of any treatment you have, and whether what you do on one day affects how you feel on the next.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>At the assessment</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          Remember, the assessor does not decide your entitlement to benefit, they send a report to DWP who decide.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are not sure about what you are being asked, ask the assessor for an explanation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take your time to answer questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are asked to do something physical such as bend or stretch, and it causes you any difficulty or pain or you can&#x2019;t do it, then tell the assessor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>If you can&#x2019;t attend</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          If you can&#x2019;t make it to the appointment you must let the DWP know. If you do not, and you do not go, your benefit will be affected and may be stopped until you do attend an assessment. You will not usually be able to cancel more than one appointment
          without it affecting your benefit.

          <p>This video is all about what you need to know when applying for Employment and Support Allowance, that’s ESA for short, for yourself or someone you care for.</p>
          <p>ESA is for people who can’t work because of illness or disability. You can start the application by phone, or by completing an application form printed off the internet</p>
          <p>To get ESA you have to pass through the Work Capability Assessment.</p>
          <p>The first part of the assessment involves filling in a medical questionnaire called the ESA 50 form. Most people then go on to have  a face-to-face assessment.</p>
          <p>A medical professional carries out the assessment, but the final decision on your claim is made by a decision maker at the Department of Work and Pensions, DWP for short, based on recommendations by the assessor.</p>
          <p>When making their recommendation, the assessor will consider:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The answers you give on the medical questionnaire.</li>
              <li>All the evidence that you send with the questionnaire or provide at the face-to-face assessment.</li>
              <li>The answers you give at your face-to-face assessment.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The assessor looks at different activities that you might be asked to carry out if you were in a job or undertaking a work related activity.</p>
          <p>These are divided into physical and mental activities.</p>
          <p>The physical activities are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Moving around and using steps.</li>
              <li>Your comfort sitting and standing.</li>
              <li>Reaching.</li>
              <li>Picking up and moving things.</li>
              <li>Using your hands.</li>
              <li>Making yourself understood, by speaking, writing or typing.</li>
              <li>Understanding verbal communication.</li>
              <li>Navigating safely.</li>
              <li>Managing continence.</li>
              <li>Staying conscious whilst awake.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The mental activities are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learning tasks.</li>
              <li>Awareness of hazards or danger.</li>
              <li>Starting or finishing tasks.</li>
              <li>Coping with change.</li>
              <li>Getting about.</li>
              <li>Coping with social engagement.</li>
              <li>Behaving appropriately.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The assessor will also look at whether you are have any difficulties feeding yourself, and any difficulties you experience in chewing or swallowing.</p>
          <p>You will be given a score from 0 to 15 for each of these physical and mental activities.</p>
          <p>For example, for the physical activity of ‘using your hands’, if you can’t press a button like a telephone keypad or turn the pages of a book, you will score 15 points. If you have full use of your hands you will score 0 points. If you can’t write with a pen or pencil, or have problems using a keyboard, your score will be in between.</p>
          <p>Some tips for you to bear in mind.</p>
          <p>When filling out the form:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Don’t be intimidated by the questions, or by the form’s length. The questions are simple and are not trying to catch you out.</li>
              <li>Give enough detail about how your condition affects you.</li>
              <li>Get help if you need it from a Citizen’s Advice Bureau or advice centre.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Throughout the assessment:</p>
          <p>Don’t put on a brave face when talking about your disability or health condition; be clear about how much it affects you.</p>
          <p>Your condition may change from day to day, be clear about how it impacts on you on your worst day.</p>
          <p>Equally, don’t pretend things are worse than they really are. Knowingly giving false answers as part of a benefit application is benefit fraud, which is a criminal offence.</p>
          <p>Don’t forget that You should keep copies of your initial application, your ESA 50 form, and all the written evidence that you send in or give to the assessor.</p>
          <p>Before you go to your face-to-face assessment you should…</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Make a list of your health conditions and disabilities, so that you don’t forget to mention them at the assessment. Think about the ways they impact upon the activities looked at by the assessment. Try taking the test on our website first, where you can save and print off your most important answers!</li>
              <li>Plan your journey to the assessment centre in advance. Don’t be late!</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Remember: You have rights at the face to face assessment</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You will be able to claim back reasonable expenses for getting to your assessment.</li>
              <li>You have the right to be accompanied at your assessment. You can ask a relative, friend, carer, or an advocate or support worker to go with you.</li>
              <li>You have a right to complain about the assessment if you don’t think it was conducted fairly.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>You will receive a letter from the DWP telling you the outcome of your application. The letter will explain how the decision was reached, including the points you scored in your test, and the amount you will be paid.</p>
          <p>If you get fewer than 15 points you will not receive ESA, and will be expected to be available for work.</p>
          <p>If you get 15 points, you will receive ESA, and you will be placed in the Work Related Activity Group OR the Support Group</p>
          <p>If you are unhappy with the decision, you can request a mandatory reconsideration. If you are still unhappy, you can appeal against it. We recommend that you get some support with this from a local Citizen’s Advice Bureau or advice centre.</p>

        <div id="application-process" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>To get ESA you have to pass through the <strong>Work Capability Assessment</strong>.</p>
          <p>The first part of the assessment involves filling in a medical questionnaire form called the ESA 50. Most people then go on to have a face-to-face assessment.</p>
          <p>A medical professional carries out the assessment, but the final decision on your claim is made by a decision maker at the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP for short) based on recommendations by the assessor.</p>
          <h3>The decision</h3>
          <p>When making their recommendation, the assessor will consider:</p>
          <ul class="ticks">
            <li>The answers you give on the medical questionnaire.</li>
            <li>All the evidence that you send with the questionnaire or provide at the face-to-face assessment.</li>
            <li>The answers you give at your face-to-face assessment.</li>

        <div id="scoring" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>The assessor looks at different activities that you might be asked to carry out if you were in a job or undertaking a work related activity. These are divided into physical and mental activities. You will be given a score from 0 to 15 for questions
            relating to each of these physical and mental activities.</p>
          <p>For example, for the physical activity of 'using your hands', if you can&#x2019;t press a button like a telephone keypad or turn the pages of a book, you will score 15 points. If you have full use of your hands you will score 0 points. If you
            can&#x2019;t write with a pen or pencil, or have problems using a keyboard, your score will be in between.</p>

          <ul class="ticks">
            <li>Don&#x2019;t put on a brave face when talking about your disability or health condition; be clear about how much it affects you.</li>
            <li>Your condition may change from day to day, be clear about how it impacts on you on your worst day.</li>
            <li>Equally, don&#x2019;t pretend things are worse than they really are. Knowingly giving false answers as part of a benefit application is benefit fraud, which is a criminal offence.</li>

          <p>Just a couple of things to remember:</p>
          <ul class="ticks">
            <li>Make a list of your health conditions and disabilities, so that you don&#x2019;t forget to mention them at the assessment. Try <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-action="start-or-resume">taking the test on our website</a> first, where you can
              save and print off your most important answers! </li>
            <li>Plan your journey to the assessment centre in advance. Don&#x2019;t be late! </li>
            <li>Your assessor will probably ask you how you got to the assessment. It may affect your claim if the answer you give seems to contradict the answers given on your form.</li>
            <li>If your condition has worsened since you completed the ESA 50 form, get a report&#x2F; letter from a doctor or other professional to explain how it has changed, and how that impacts on you.</li>
            <li>Consider keeping a diary which you can show the assessor. This will help you track your good and bad days, the impact of any treatment you have, and whether what you do on one day affects what you do on the next.</li>

            the outcome, but if so, you will also get written confirmation of the result.</p>
          <p>If you receive less than 15 points you will not be entitled to Employment and Support Allowance. You may be entitled to Job Seekers Allowance or other benefits. If you score 15 points or more, you will be entitled to ESA. Dependent on the detail
            of your answers, you may be placed in the <strong>Work Related Activity Group</strong> in which case you will be required to undertake some activities to help you become work ready in the future, or the <strong>Support Group</strong>, in which
