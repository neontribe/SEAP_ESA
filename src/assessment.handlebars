      <h2>Remember</h2>
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          Plan your journey to the assessment - your appointment letter will usually have a map with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your assessor will probably ask you how you got to the assessment. It may affect your claim if your answer seems to contradict the answers given on your form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask for a travel reimbursement claim form at the assessment if you do not already have one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you keep bus/train tickets/receipts or parking tickets/receipts for you and anyone who goes with you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Letters from the DWP</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          You need to take your appointment letter and proof of ID to the assessment. Your letter tells you what is acceptable proof of ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your appointment letter tells you about some other things to take such as medical letters, glasses, walking aids etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Preparing your answers</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          If your condition has worsened since you completed the form, get a report/letter from a doctor or other professional to explain how it has changed, and how that impacts on you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down points you want to make about your conditions and their impact on you in case they are not covered/asked about by the assessor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write down any questions you may have for the assessor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider keeping a diary which you can show the assessor. This will help you track your good and bad days, the impact of any treatment you have, and whether what you do on one day affects how you feel on the next.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>At the assessment</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          You can take someone with you to the assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember, the assessor does not decide your entitlement to benefit, they send a report to DWP who decides. You have the right to challenge the outcome of the assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are not sure about what you are being asked, ask the assessor for an explanation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take your time to answer questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are asked to do something physical such as bend or stretch, and it causes you any difficulty or pain or you can&#x2019;t do it, then tell the assessor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>If you can&#x2019;t attend</h3>
      <ul class="ticks">
        <li>
          If you can&#x2019;t make it to the appointment you must let the DWP know. If you do not, and you do not go, your benefit will be affected and may be stopped until you do attend an assessment. You will not usually be able to cancel more than one appointment without it affecting your benefit.

      <p><strong>Screen 9: </strong>You will be given a score from 0 to 15 for each of these physical and mental activities.</p>
      <p>For example, for the physical activity of â€˜using your handsâ€™, if you canâ€™t press a button like a telephone keypad or turn the pages of a book, you will score 15 points. If you have full use of your hands you will score 0 points. If you canâ€™t write with a pen or pencil, or have problems using a keyboard, your score will be in between.</p>

          <p>To get ESA you have to pass through the <strong>Work Capability Assessment</strong>.</p>
          <p>The first part of the assessment involves filling in a medical questionnaire called the ESA50 form.</p>

          <p>A medical professional carries out the assessment but the final decision on your claim is made by a decision maker at the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) based on recommendations by the assessor.</p>

          <p>For example, for the physical activity of 'using your hands', if you canâ€™t press a button such as a telephone keypad or turn the pages of a book, you will score 15 points.
