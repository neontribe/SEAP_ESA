<div class="flex-center">
  <p>At your assessment, you'll be asked questions about things you can and can't do.</p>
  <p>Here you can try some questions, grouped into activities that might be affected by your condition. Each group has a maximum of 8 questions. You can have a break at any time and come back to where you left off. If you aren't sure which to look at first, we can <a data-action="set-cat" data-category="random-category">pick one for you at random<a/>.</p>
  <p>Remember when you are answering: The assessment looks at how well you are able to do things <strong>most of the time</strong>. It also takes into account any pain or stiffness you feel, how tiredness, any medication or treatment affect you, and how your condition changes.</p>
